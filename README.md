# Unit 14 Sequelize Homework: Reverse Engineering Code

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

This is a different approach to web development. Rather than having a team member explain every line of code for me, I have 

dissected the code and in a Google Doc, have documented a tutorial explaining every file and itâ€™s purpose.

## Deployed Google Doc Tutorial:

## User Story: 
```
AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

## Business Context

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.
